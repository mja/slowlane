Title: Simulate pedigrees for organisms with slow life-histories.
Description: slowlane is a set of methods for generating and simulating
    pedigrees with a focus on slow-developing, iteroparous organisms (mostly
    Primates but also Proboscidea and Cetacea). The output is meant to
    be used as input to animal model estimation programs for the purpose
